# git-training
Another test repo for use when doing plural sight 'intro to git' course

=> Nothing to see here, move along <=

Git is hard to learn!
---------------------

So after a few mistakes I checked out this old plural sight course
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/introduction-to-git/table-of-contents

And I created this repository from the command line, while doing the training steps.
Its just a few powershell scripts and docs
